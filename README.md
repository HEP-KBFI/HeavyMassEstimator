# Heavy mass estimator 
designed for estimating the mass of heavy resonance in X->HH->bbWW->bblvlv with two neutrinos in final states.  

# Check out code
git clone https://github.com/tahuang1991/HeavyMassEstimator

# C++ version
ROOT must be installed before as heavy mass estimator package used ROOT package 

how to use heavy mass estimator(HME) package
C++ version:
the HME class is defined in interface/heavyMassEstimator.h and src/heavyMassEstimator.cc
the constructor of HME is 
```
    heavyMassEstimator(TLorentzVector* lep1_lorentz, TLorentzVector* lep2_lorentz, TLorentzVector* b1jet_lorentz, TLorentzVector* b2jet_lorentz, 
	TLorentzVector* totjets_lorentz,TLorentzVector* met_lorentz, TLorentzVector* nu1_lorentz, TLorentzVector* nu2_lorentz,
	TLorentzVector* b_genp_lorentz, TLorentzVector* bbar_genp_lorentz, TLorentzVector* h2tohh_lorentz, int onshellMarker, bool simulation,	       bool PUsample_,
	int ievent, bool weightfromonshellnupt_func, bool weightfromonshellnupt_hist, bool weightfromonoffshellWmass_hist,
        int iterations, std::string RefPDFfile, bool useMET, int bjetrescaleAlgo, int metcorrection, int verbose_=0
	);
```
in this constructor:  

  lep1_lorentz, lep2_lorentz are the [lorentz vector] (https://root.cern.ch/doc/v608/LorentzVectorPage.html) in ROOT for two leptons
     
  b1jet_lorentz, b2jet_lorentz are the lorentz vector for two jets,
  
  totjets_lorentz is the lorentz vector sum of all jets with pT > 20 and abs(eta)<2.5
     
  nu1_lorentz, nu2_lorentz, b_genp_lorentz, bbar_genp_lorentz, h2tohh_lorentz, simulation contains simulation information and are used for debugging. The other constructor can ignore those inputs from simulation information. 
  
  PUsample_ is a boolean whether the input sample is PU or not. MET used in HME is smeared according to MET resolution and MET resolution depends on PU
  
 ievent is event id and used for debug purpose 
 
 weightfromonshellnupt_func, weightfromonshellnupt_hist, weightfromonoffshellWmass_hist are booleans to define how to assign the weights to iteration results
 
 RefPDFfile is a root file containing the histograms used for weighting and jet correction. The histograms are derived from delphes sample and used in Pheno study(https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.035007)
 
 iterations is the number of eta-phi pair random generation.
 
 useMET is whether to use MET from met collection or calculate MET from leptons and jets with momentum and energy conservation law
 
 bjetrescaleAlgo and metcorrection are used to define how to correct bjets and met


# how to compile and run C++ version
prerequisites to compile the package:
  -ROOT

to compile the code:
```
cd HeavyMassEstimator
make
```

to run heavy mass estimator with testHME:
```
cd bin
./testHME
```

testHME.cc:

the example code to use heavyMassEstimator is shown in bin/testHME.cc and 10 events are hard coded in testHME.cc



# Python version
python version code is under scripts/

scripts/HeavyMassEstimator.py define the a class called HeavyMassEstimator, very similar to C++ version:

HeavyMassEstimator used two leptons and two jets, MET as inputs to get HME results.
PUsample_ is by defualt is true and MET is taken from met collect in event (for useMET in C++ version)
bjetrescaleAlgo and metcorrection, by default, are taken the values that give the best performance in past

The example of calling HeavyMassEstimator in python is scripts/testHME.py
